The NetOffer-WP-Plugin connects your Word Press site to the NetOffer System allowing you to use the digital marketing tools available on NetOffer.

== Description: ==

The NetOffer System is designed primarily as a business digital marketing toolkit. Included are the following:  

1. Customer Relationship Management Database: This is a feature rich database tool with many integrated features. You can record comments, track emails sent to your customer list, schedule reminders, update your records with the source files from your client account if you clients also have an account on NetOffer, generate automated messages to new members to your database when they sign up, and much more.  
2. Email Marketing System: You can send emails to individuals in your database, or to selected groups of database records. These emails are feature rich and can contain both attachments and videos if you wish.  
3. Marketing Automation System: You can create an unlimited number of marketing campaigns, and each campaign can have an unlimited number of messages. Each campaign can be triggered to start for an individual Member or a group of Members of your Community (your database).  
4. Classified Advertising System: The Classified Ad system allows you to post Classified Ads that show up on your website. If you wish, the Members of your Community can also post ads, or you can deny that privilege, or you can allow it for all then deny specific individuals, or you deny the privilege for all and permit for specific individuals.  
5. Business Products and Services Listing System: You can list an unlimited number of products and services that you sell, or that you purchase. You can research the system and find sellers for the things you want to purchase, or buyers for the things you want to sell. This is like Match.com but for business the Buyer is always anonymous until the buyer decides to reveal themselve to the Seller.  
6. An Events Calendar: You can post events in the events calendar, and you can allow your Members to do so, if you wish.  
7. A B-2-B Connectivity System: You can research the system to find Buyers or Sellers that you are interested in interacting with.  
8. Business Networking Activity Tracking: If you are involved in weekly business networking groups you can use the system to send Referrals, Testimonials, record 1-1 Meetings, and record you Meeting Attendance and your Guests if you brought them to a meeting.  
9. Refferral Tracking System: You can keep track of Referrals that you have both Sent and Received so that you have a record of your Referral activities with your network.  
10. Testimonials Generation and Tracking: You can send and receive testimonials to others on the NetOffer System and you always have complete control over whether those testimonials show up on your website. If you approve them and they are edited by the Sender then they automatically come off of your website until you re-approve the edited versions.  
11. Networking Group Activity Reporting System: If you are the facilitator of a networking group you can use the system to track the activity within your group. You can track Referrals, 1-1 Meetings, Attendance, Guests, etcl. You can generate reports on the activity so that you can wee how vibrant your group is.  
12. Private Membership System: If you sell intellectual property you can create private content that only your Members can get access to. You can control access to the content by setting access levels and then establishing similar access levels for the members of you database. There is special widget for this service and this service is only offered to people who have Upgraded to the Platinum Account version which has a monthly fee of $27.00.
